    Microsoft as eligible for the upgrade. After upgrading, you
    may no longer use the product that formed the basis for
    your upgrade eligibility.

 3. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE.  
    This EULA applies to updates or supplements to the original
    Product provided by Microsoft, unless we provide other terms
    along with the update or supplement.   

 4. TRANSFER-Internal.  You may move the Product to a different
    Workstation Computer.  Transfer to Third Party.  The
    initial user of the Product may make a one-time transfer
    of the Product to another end user.  The transfer has to
    include all component parts, media, printed materials, this
    EULA, and if applicable, the Certificate of Authenticity. 
    The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a
    consignment.  Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving
    the transferred Product must agree to all the EULA terms. 
    No Rental.  You may not rent, lease, lend, or provide
    commercial hosting services with the Product. 

 5. LIMITATION ON REVERSE ENGINEERING,
    DECOMPILATION, AND DISASSEMBLY.

    Product, except and only to the extent that it is expressly
    permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this
    limitation.  

 6. TERMINATION.  Without prejudice to any other rights,
    Microsoft may cancel this EULA if you do not abide by the
    terms and conditions of this EULA, in which case you must
    destroy all copies of the Product and all of its component
    parts.

 7. PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES

    WA 98052-6399 or the Microsoft subsidiary serving your 
    country.

10. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  You acknowledge
    that the Product is of U.S. origin and subject to U.S.
    export jurisdiction.  You agree to comply with all
    applicable international and national laws that apply to
    the Product, including the U.S. Export Administration
    Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use, and destination
    restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments.   For
    additional information see 
    <http://www.microsoft.com/exporting/>.

11. AUTOMATIC INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.  
    The Product features described below are enabled by default 
    to connect via the Internet to Microsoft computer systems
    automatically, without separate notice to you.  You consent
    to the operation of these features, unless you choose to
    switch them off or not use them.  Microsoft does not obtain
    personally identifiable information through any of these
    features.  For more information about these features,
    please see your Software documentation or the Microsoft
    online support site.

    a. Windows Update Features.  Under the Product's default
    configuration, if you connect a device to your
    Workstation Computer and the correct device driver
    is not available on your Workstation Computer, then
    Windows Update features on your Workstation Computer
    (including Device Manager and the Plug & Play CDM
    Module) automatically attempt to check Microsoft
    computer systems via the Internet for the correct device
    driver.  Having this happen automatically makes 
    Plug-and-Play installation of new hardware a better 
    experience for customers.  You may switch off Windows 
    Update's automatic driver checking feature.

    b. Web Content Features.  Under the Product's default
    configuration, if you are connected to the Internet,
    several features of the Product are enabled by default
    to retrieve content from Microsoft computer systems
    and display it to you.  When you activate such a
    feature, it uses standard Internet protocols, which
    transmit the type of operating system, browser and
    language code of your Workstation Computer to the
    Microsoft computer system so that the content can be
    viewed properly from your Workstation Computer.  These
    features only operate when you activate them, and you
    may choose to switch them off or not use them.  An
    example of this feature is Appshelp.

    c. Digital Certificates.  Use of certificates based on the
    X.509 standard is an important security feature of
    the Product.  Certain functions of the X.509
    implementation (for example, certificate revocation
    checking and certificate path building) connect via
    the Internet to computer systems belonging to Microsoft
    and other digital certificate authorities to check
    the validity of digital certificates that you receive
    from third parties during certain Internet-based
    operations (for example, communications secured with
    SSL or IPsec, mail secured with S/MIME, and smartcard
    authentication).  In accordance with the X.509 standard,
    the Product automatically retrieves user certificates
    and certificate revocation lists when you attempt to
    access certificate protected content.  Additionally,
    the Product's Auto Root Update feature will occasionally
    update the list of trusted certificate authorities. 
    Auto Root Update is an optional feature; you can
    uninstall it if you do not desire it to function. 
    The other security operations based on the X.509
    standard can be prevented from operating by blocking
    Internet access.

    d. Windows Media Digital Rights Management.  Content
    providers are using the digital rights management
    technology for Windows Media contained in this Product
    ("WM-DRM") to protect the integrity of their content
    ("Secure Content") so that their intellectual property,
    including copyright, in such content is not 
    misappropriated.  Portions of this Product and third party
    applications such as media players use WM-DRM to play 
    Secure Content ("WM-DRM Software").  If the WM-DRM
    Software's security has been compromised, owners of Secure
    Content ("Secure Content Owners") may request that
    Microsoft revoke the WM-DRM Software's right to copy, 
    display and/or play Secure Content.  Revocation does not
    alter the WM-DRM Software's ability to play unprotected
    content.  A list of revoked WM-DRM Software is sent to 
    your computer whenever you download a license for Secure
    Content from the Internet.  Microsoft may, in
    conjunction with such license, also download revocation
    lists onto your computer on behalf of Secure Content
    Owners.  Secure Content Owners may also require you
    to upgrade some of the WM-DRM components in this Product
    ("WM-DRM Upgrades") before accessing their content. 
    When you attempt to play such content, WM-DRM Software
    built by Microsoft will notify you that a WM-DRM Upgrade
    is required and then ask for your consent before the
    WM-DRM Upgrade is downloaded.  WM-DRM Software built
    by third parties may do the same.  If you decline the
    upgrade, you will not be able to access content that
    requires the WM-DRM Upgrade; however, you will still
    be able to access unprotected content and Secure Content
    that does not require the upgrade.  WM-DRM features
    that access the Internet, such as acquiring new licenses
    and/or performing a required WM-DRM Upgrade, can be
    switched off.  When these features are switched off,
    you will still be able to play Secure Content if you
    have a valid license for such content already stored
    on your computer.

    e. Windows Media Player.  Some features of Windows Media
    Player automatically contact Microsoft computer systems
    if you use Windows Media Player or specific features
    of it:  features that (A) check for new codecs if your
    Workstation Computer does not have the correct ones
    for content you attempt to play (this feature may be
    switched off), and (B) check for new versions of Windows
    Media Player (this feature will operate only when you
    are using Windows Media Player).

The following Limited Warranty applies if you acquired this
Product in the US or Canada:


16. LIMITED WARRANTY FOR PRODUCTS ACQUIRED IN
    THE US AND CANADA.  

    Microsoft warrants that the Product will perform 
    substantially in accordance with the accompanying materials 
    for a period of ninety days from the date of receipt. 

    If an implied warranty or condition is created by your state
    /jurisdiction and federal or state/provincial law prohibits
    disclaimer of it, you also have an implied warranty or
    condition, BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS 
    DISCOVERED DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS 
    LIMITED WARRANTY (NINETY DAYS).  AS TO
    ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE NINETY
    (90) DAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR
    CONDITION OF ANY KIND.  Some 
    states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an
    implied warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation
    may not apply to you.  
    
    Any supplements or updates to the Product, including without
    limitation, any (if any) service packs or hot fixes provided
    to you after the expiration of the ninety day Limited 
    Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or condition,
    express, implied or statutory.
    LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL
    OR OTHER DAMAGES.  Your exclusive 
    remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty is as set
    forth below.  Except for any refund elected by Microsoft, 
    YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES, 
    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the Product does
    not meet Microsoft's Limited Warranty, and, to the maximum 
    extent allowed by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of
    its essential purpose.  The terms of Section 18 below 
    ("Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other 
    Damages") are also incorporated into this Limited Warranty. 
    Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or 
    limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the 
    above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.  This 
    Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You may 
    have others which vary from state/jurisdiction to 
    state/jurisdiction.  
    YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Microsoft's and its suppliers' entire 
    liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at Microsoft's 
    option from time to time exercised subject to applicable law,
    (a) return of the price paid (if any) for the Product, or 
    (b) repair or replacement of the Product, that does not meet
    this Limited Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with 
    a copy of your receipt. You will receive the remedy elected 
    by Microsoft without charge, except that you are responsible
    for any expenses you may incur (e.g. cost of shipping the 
    Product to Microsoft).  This Limited Warranty is void if 
    failure of the Product has resulted from accident, abuse,
    misapplication, abnormal use or a virus. Any replacement 
    Product will be warranted for the remainder of the original 
    warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. 
    Outside the United States or Canada, neither these remedies 
    nor any product support services offered by Microsoft are 
    available without proof of purchase from an authorized 
    international source.  To exercise your remedy, contact: 
    Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft Sales Information Center/
    One Microsoft Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399, or the Microsoft 
    subsidiary serving your country.

    Warranty that appears above is the only express warranty
    made to you and is provided in lieu of any other express
    warranties (if any) created by any documentation or
    packaging.  Except for the Limited Warranty and to the
    maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Microsoft and
    its suppliers provide the Product and support services (if
    any) AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, and

    AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES.  TO THE
    MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MICROSOFT OR ITS

    SUPPLIER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

19. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES. 
    Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur for any
    reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, all
    damages referenced above and all direct or general

The following MICROSOFT GUARANTEE applies to you if you acquired
this Product in any other country:   

Statutory rights not affected - The following guarantee is not
restricted to any territory and does not affect any statutory
rights that you may have from your reseller or from Microsoft if
you acquired the Product directly from Microsoft.   If you
acquired the Product or any support services in Australia, New
Zealand or Malaysia, please see the "Consumer rights" section
below. 

The guarantee - The Product is designed and offered as

advised to back-up your files regularly.  Provided that you have
a valid license, Microsoft guarantees that a) for a period of 90
days from the date of receipt of your license to use the Product
or the shortest period permitted by applicable law it will
perform substantially in accordance with the written materials
that accompany the product; and b) any support services provided
by Microsoft shall be substantially as described in applicable
written materials provided to you by Microsoft and Microsoft
support engineers will use reasonable efforts, care and skill to
solve any problem issues.  In the event that the Product fails to

replace the Product or (b) return the price you paid.  This
guarantee is void if failure of the Product results from
accident, abuse or misapplication.  Any replacement Product will
be guaranteed for the remainder of the original guarantee period
or 30 days, whichever period is longer.  You agree that the above
guarantee is your sole guarantee in relation to the Product and
any support services.

applicable law and except as provided in the Microsoft Guarantee,
Microsoft and its suppliers shall not be liable for any damages

information or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use or
